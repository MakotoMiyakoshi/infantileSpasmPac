# infantileSpasmPac
This code is to preprocess clinical recordings of human scalp EEG data in a research of infantile spasm. The code uses artifact subspace reconstruction and independent component analysis to apply a phase-amplitude coupling analysis using Matlab software libraries. The order of the preprocessings is shown in the file names. The code has dependency on EEGLAB and the following plugins: PREP_Pipeline, PACT, DIPFIT, and ICLabel. For the Miyakoshi et al. (under review) infantile spasm pipeline paper.
